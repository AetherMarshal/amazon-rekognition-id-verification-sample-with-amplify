## Identity Verification with Amazon Rekognition

This sample, built using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), is meant to showcase recommended flows when using [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) for Identity Verification. There are two key components in this sample:

- Frontend: A React/NextJS web application for exercising the key flows
- Backend: An GraphQL based backend built using AWS AppSync

## Flows

Users interested in implemented Identity Verification with Amazon Rekognition should consider the following flows.

### New user registration

1. Check face image quality via the [DetectFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DetectFaces.html).
2. Use [SearchFacesByImage API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_SearchFacesByImage.html) against the collection(s) to check for any duplicate registration.
3. Index the face image using [IndexFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_IndexFaces.html) and use the ExternalImageID (Social Security number or a similar unique ID) parameter to associate the face embeddings with the ExternalImageID.
4. Store the face image in the S3 bucket along with the user metadata (face-id returned from the IndexFaces API, SSN and S3 URL) in DynamoDB. The SSN or a unique person identifier can be used as a key to lookup S3 URL and the face-id.

### New user registration w/ Id card

1. Check face image quality via the [DetectFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DetectFaces.html).
2. Check face image quality of face on Id card via the [DetectFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DetectFaces.html).
3. Use [CompareFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_CompareFaces.html) to ensure that the face on the supplied Id card and the face on the image match.
4. Use [SearchFacesByImage API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_SearchFacesByImage.html) against the collection(s) to check for any duplicate registration.
5. Index the face image using [IndexFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_IndexFaces.html) and use the ExternalImageID (Social Security number or a similar unique ID) parameter to associate the face embeddings with the ExternalImageID.
6. Store the face image in the S3 bucket along with the user metadata (face-id returned from the IndexFaces API, SSN and S3 URL) in DynamoDB. The SSN or a unique person identifier can be used as a key to lookup S3 URL and the face-id.

### Existing user login
1. Check face image quality via the [DetectFaces API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_DetectFaces.html).
2. Get the S3 URI from DynamoDB using Social Security number (or a similar unique ID) as a lookup key.
3. Search against the collection could be performed with [SearchFacesbyImage API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_SearchFacesByImage.html). If there is a face match and personâ€™s ID, and the ExternalImageID match a successful response can be returned.
